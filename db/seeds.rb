Activity.create(name: "Egg Throwing", description: "According to the World Egg Throwing Federation, egg throwing has been a sport enjoyed by millions of people since early humans discovered the delight of watching a failure of another to catch a tossed egg. Eggheads have the opportunity to participate in the annual World Egg Throwing Championship, which involves a variation of games, in Swaton, England.

The World Egg Throwing Championships take place in the village of Swaton in Lincolnshire in June. The sport is thought to date back to at least 1322 when the local abbot ensured the attendance at church of his peasants by providing them alms of one egg for each attendee. When the River Eau flooded, preventing people getting to church, the monks would hurl the eggs over to the waiting peasants. The games have been played ever since. Some games involve pairs of contestants throwing – and trying to catch - the fragile missiles. In others, teams construct gravity-powered devices to launch eggs towards one of their members. Another popular activity is Russian Egg Roulette where participants select from five hard-boiled eggs and one raw before smashing them against their own foreheads.", image_url: "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f0a0ac1700009a01569c91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale", wiki_link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_tossing")

Activity.create(name: "Shin Kicking", description: "Shin-kicking, also known as hacking or purring, is a combat sport that involves two contestants attempting to kick each other on the shin in order to force their opponent to the ground. It has been described as an English martial art. It originated in England in the early 17th century, and was one of the most popular events at the Cotswold Olimpick Games until the Games ended in the 1850s. It also became a popular pastime among Cornish miners. In the 19th century the sport was also practised by British immigrants to the United States. It was included in the 1951 revival of the Cotswold Olimpick Games, and remains one of its most popular events, run as the World Shin-kicking Championships. The event now draws crowds of thousands of spectators. 
During each round, the combatants face each other and hold on to each other's collar. Traditionally (in the Cotswold Olimpicks) they wear white coats, representing shepherds' smocks. They typically attempt to strike their opponent's shin with the inside of the foot as well as their toes. Success in the event requires both agility and the ability to endure pain, the loser crying out sufficient when he has had enough. The matches are observed by a referee, or stickler, who determines the score of the match. Modern competitions are won by the combatant who wins two out of three against his competitor.
Legend has it that some shin-kickers wore steel-toe boots during the competitions and tried to build pain tolerance by hitting their shins with hammers. In modern competitions the combatants are required to wear soft shoes and stuff their trouser legs with straw for padding. Ambulance crews also attend the events in case of injury.", image_url: "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f0a1a814000077002e5408.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale", wiki_link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin-kicking")

What the dickens is bubble football?, we hear you cry. It could be compared to many things: Football in a sumo suit. Zorbing without the hill. Fresh hell in a plastic sphere. In short, it involves climbing into a giant inflatable ball (similar to those used for zorbing), and attempting to play football. We've not had a go ourselves, but the videos suggest bubble football doesn't require much in the way of skills — rather a case of blundering your way into your well-padded opponents.

If you fancy getting beaten up en masse by your mates, here are your options for playing bubble football in London. Sadly it doesn't seem widespread enough yet to have drop-in games, or teams to join (if you know differently, let us know in the comments), so it's a case of hiring out a whole match for a birthday party, stag or hen do, office away day, or afternoon of general merriment.", image_url: "https://assets.londonist.com/uploads/2014/07/i640/bubble-football.png", wiki_link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_football")

There are two versions of the grass games: the four-player game and the five-player game.
In the four-player game, cycle polo is played in a rectangular grass field, 150 by 100 metres (490 ft × 330 ft) officially, unofficially whatever field is big enough. Moreover, official dimensions can vary between 120 by 150 metres (390 ft × 490 ft) in length on 80 by 100 metres (260 ft × 330 ft) in width. The ball used approximately 2.5 inches (64 mm) in diameter and the mallet is of maximum length 1 metre (3 ft 3 in).
Goals are four metres wide and made with two goal posts without any crossbar.
There are six members in a team, of which four are on field at any one time. The other two are used as substitutes. International matches are played for a duration of 30 minutes, divided into periods of 7.5 minutes known as chukkars. Extra time can be used to determine the winner in the event of the scores being tied at normal time.
A player following the ball on its exact line and taking it on his off side will be entitled to the right of way over all other players.
If a deliberate severe foul is committed at the vicinity of the goal, the team that is fouled is automatically given a goal. Less severe fouls are awarded 15-metre and 25-metre free hits. In the event of deliberate fouls or dangerous fouls, the umpire can issue a yellow card (warning) and in case of repeated or severe fouls a red card (ejection). The ejected player can be replaced by a substitute after the end of the current chukkar if the umpire allows it.
In the 5 player game (mostly used in Europe), bicycle polo is played in a rectangular grass field, 100 by 60 metres (330 ft × 200 ft) officially, such as a football or a rugby field. Moreover, official dimensions can vary between 80–110 metres (260–360 ft) in length and 40–70 metres (130–230 ft) in width. The ball shall be round and may not be less than 32 cm (12.6 inches) or greater than 38 cm (15.0 inches) in circumference when inflated and the mallet is of maximum length 1 metre (3 ft 3 in).
Goals are 4 meters wide (5 meters in the national French rules) and made with 2 goal posts and a 2.75 meter (3 yards) high crossbar.
There are eight members in a team of which five are on the field at any one time, including a goalkeeper. The other three are used as substitutes. Matches are played for a duration of 60 minutes divided into 4 periods of 15 minutes each. Extra time can be used to determine the winner in case the scores are tied at normal time.
In order for a player to touch the ball or attack an opponent, the player must be holding the mallet in his right hand, the handlebar in his left hand, and must not be touching the ground with any part of his body.
In order to attack an opponent who is playing the ball on their right side, a player shall attack the opponent on the right side of the opponent with the ball in the middle of both players (i.e. the ball shall be on the left side of the attacking player).
In order to attack an opponent who is playing the ball on their left side, a player shall attack the opponent on the left side of the opponent with the ball in the middle of both players (i.e. the ball shall be on the right side of the attacking player).
The right of way is given to the player who follows or possesses the ball. In the penalty area, the right of way is lost in favour of the goalkeeper.", image_url: "http://www.vernmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Vern-main-image-1140px-810x437.jpg", wiki_link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_polo")

Activity.create(name: "Worm Charming", description: "Worm charming, worm grunting, and worm fiddling are methods of attracting earthworms from the ground. The activity is usually performed to collect bait for fishing but can also take the form of a competitive sport in areas such as east Texas. As a skill and profession worm charming is now very rare, with the art being passed through generations to ensure that it survives.

Most worm charming methods involve vibrating the soil, which encourages the worms to the surface. In 2008 researchers from Vanderbilt University claimed that the worms surface because the vibrations are similar to those produced by digging moles, which prey on earthworms. The same technique is used by many species of bird, which devour the worms as they appear above ground.
The activity is known by several different names and the apparatus and techniques vary significantly. Worm grunting generally refers to the use of a stob, a wooden stake that is driven into the ground, and a rooping iron which is used to rub the stob. Worm fiddling also uses a wooden stake but utilises a dulled saw which is dragged along its top.
Techniques vary from sprinkling the turf with water, tea and beer, to music or just twanging with a garden fork. In some organized competitions, detergents and mechanical diggers have been banned.", image_url: "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02297/wormcharming_2297446k.jpg", wiki_link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_charming")

Activity.create(name: "Pillow Fighting", description: "The Pillow Fight League (PFL) is a Toronto-based semi-professional sports league centred on public pillow fights. The tongue in cheek women's sport is hosted in a fighting arena, much like a boxing or wrestling match. The League was founded by PFL Commissioner Stacey P. Case, and Honorary PFL Commissioner Craig Daniels in February 2004. The formal league launched at a Canadian goth bar called The Vatikan in downtown Toronto. Events since then have been hosted in both Montreal, Quebec and New York City, but the primary seat of the League remains in Toronto, Ontario. Fighter Abbie Roadkill, originally of British descent, recently speculated about a similar event in the United Kingdom.
Fights within the League now feature either two or three girls, the latter referred to as a damage à trois, and a codified set of rules. Fighters frequently incur cuts, scrapes and bruises. There have also been more serious injuries, including concussions, black eyes, lost teeth, split lips, torn muscles, and bruised kidneys.
The League grew out of a pair of live events held by performers from Canadian burlesque troupe Skin Tight Outta Sight at a performance of Mr. Case's band (named for tijuana bibles) at New Year's Eve 2004 and 2005. The latter featured the first instance of live tryouts for members of the audience. The events that followed in 2006 at the Vatikan launched the new League-sponsored series of events primarily focused around the pillow fighting bouts. A potential moneymaker for its founders, the League saw television rights snapped up in 2007 by reality television and sitcom producers Eddie October (executive producer of Tommy Lee Goes to College and The Roseanne Show) and Al Berman (executive producer of The Biggest Loser and Survivor).

Activity.create(name: "Bossaball", description: "Bossaball is a team sport that originated in Spain and was conceptualised by Belgian Filip Eyckmans in 2005. Bossaball is a ball game between two teams, combining elements of volleyball, football and gymnastics with music into a sport. It is played on an inflatable court featuring a trampoline on each side of the net. The trampolines allow the players to bounce high enough to spike the ball over the net and score direct points.
The word bossa, which is sometimes translated as style, flair or attitude in Brazilian Portuguese, is commonly associated with Bossa Nova, a samba-influenced type of Brazilian music. The name Bossaball, therefore, expresses the aim to combine sports, music and positive vibrations.

A Bossaball game is played between two teams of four players. The aim is for each team to ground the ball on the opponent’s field. The height of the net in between both fields can be adjusted for different levels such as professionals, intermediates, beginners, or children. Players are not allowed to touch the net and always have to remain with at least one body part on their own side.
One player (the attacker) is positioned on the trampoline, the others around him/her on the inflatables. A player from the serving team (the server) throws or kicks the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve). The opposing team must use a combination of no more than five contacts with the ball to return it to the other side of the net. These contacts can be exercised using any body part:
Volley touch
Touching the ball one single time according to the traditional volleyball rules. With the lower arms, touch, spike or drop shot. Throwing the ball or guiding the ball for more than 1 second is not allowed.
Football touch
Touching the ball up to two times (= double football touch or a DST) with any body part except the hands or arms. Example: One can control the ball with the chest and then pass it with the head or foot. Any combination of body parts is allowed as long as none of the two contacts is with the hands or arms. A DST is counted as one pass.
Of the five maximum contacts, the ball has to be played at least once using the football touch technique, once the second pass has been played.

Attacker about to spike with the foot in order to gain extra points,
During a rally, the ball is tossed around while the attacker jumps on the trampoline in order to gain height. The attack begins when one of the rallying players aims the ball's trajectory towards a spot in the air where the attacker can hit it (spike or kick) and returns the ball over the net.
The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offense. The team on defense attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court: players at the net jump and reach above the top (and across the plane) of the net in order to block the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig (usually a forearm pass of a hard-driven ball, or a foot control). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offense.
The game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth, until the ball touches the court within the scoring zones or a mistake is committed.
The roll of a referee in Bossaball is very similar to volleyball. Competition games are played with three referees: one primary and two assistants. The main referee stands under the net on the playing area. He or she is responsible for the final decisions and especially focuses on the net. The two assistant referees are positioned at the opposite corners of the court. They have to keep track of the maximum amount of touches, the soccer touch and decide if the ball is in or out of bounds.", image_url: "https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F176477%252Fe095b577061b4bdda765d414321331f4.png%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252880%2529.png?signature=BxTN_bMRlUt8Ei_2ydV8l7UGcjE=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com", wiki_link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossaball")
